## Usage
This is a simple web service that registers http requests from a specific Ip address. The registered events are triggered from a motion detection application running on an AXIS Communications camera. For each detection, the camera sends a notification to the server which is logged in an array of timestamps. 
The whole assignment was done as part of a course on Connected Systems during the Computer Science programme at Malm√∂ University, Sweden.
